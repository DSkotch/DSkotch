- 👋 Hi, I’m Scott Heemstra. I'm 22 years old and I live in California, USA.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and storytelling. Particularly I like Visual Novels and Adventure games. I'm thinking of making a simple text adventure to gain experience
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing to resume college at CSU Channel Islands after having taken a 1 year break due to COVID-19. I'm preparing to retake a "Computer Architecture and Assembly Language" course that I was unable to finish last semester
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, anything really. I'm not a very experienced coder but I have a strong foundation & a lifetime of computer savvyness. Right now I'm just trying to reget my bearings since my coding skill is a little rusty, so I'm looking for basic exercises I can do to get my "little grey cells"flowing
- 📫 How to reach me: @D_Skotch on Twitter. @D.Skotch#1984 on Discord.
